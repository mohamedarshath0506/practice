# HTML Block and Inline

The div tag element is a block-level and is often used as a container for other HTML elements (full width).

The span tag element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document (content width only).

```html
<div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">
  <h2>London</h2>
  <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
</div>

<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">blue</span> eyes and my father has <span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold;">dark green</span>
